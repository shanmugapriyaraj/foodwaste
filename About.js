     <h1>Food waste Management system</h1>
     <p>
     Food waste management systems play a crucial role in addressing the growing concern of food waste and its environmental impact. These systems aim to reduce the amount of food waste generated, divert it from landfills, and promote more sustainable practices throughout the food supply chain.

One key aspect of food waste management systems is prevention. This involves implementing strategies to minimize food waste at various stages, starting from production and processing to distribution and consumption. This can be achieved through improved inventory management, better forecasting techniques, and educating consumers about the importance of reducing food waste.

Another important component is food recovery. Rather than letting edible food go to waste, efforts are made to collect and redistribute surplus food to those in need. This can involve collaborations between food banks, charitable organizations, and businesses to ensure that excess food is redirected to people who can benefit from it. </p>
